//! # Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum
//!
//! Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.
//!
//! He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the
//! North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next. Moves are always exactly one
//! house to the north (`^`), south (`v`), east (`>`), or west (`<`). After each move, he delivers
//! another present to the house at his new location.
//!
//! However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions
//! are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once. How many houses
//! receive at least one present?
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! - `>` delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.
//! - `^>v<` delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including twice to the house at his
//!   starting/ending location.
//! - `^v^v^v^v^v` delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only 2 houses.

/// The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a robot version of himself, Robo-Santa,

/// # Examples
///
/// - `^v` delivers presents to 3 houses, because Santa goes north, and then Robo-Santa goes south.
/// - `^>v<` now delivers presents to 3 houses, and Santa and Robo-Santa end up back where they
///   started.
/// - `^v^v^v^v^v` now delivers presents to 11 houses, with Santa going one direction and
///   Robo-Santa going the other.
