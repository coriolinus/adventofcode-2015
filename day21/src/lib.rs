//! # Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX
//!
//! Little Henry Case got a new video game for Christmas. It's an RPG, and he's stuck on a boss.
//! He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop. He hands you the controller.
//!
//! In this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns attacking. The player
//! always goes first. Each attack reduces the opponent's hit points by at least `1`. The first
//! character at or below 0 hit points loses.
//!
//! Damage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's damage score minus the
//! defender's armor score. An attacker always does at least 1 damage. So, if the attacker has a
//! damage score of 8, and the defender has an armor score of 3, the defender loses 5 hit points.
//! If the defender had an armor score of 300, the defender would still lose 1 hit point.
//!
//! Your damage score and armor score both start at zero. They can be increased by buying items in
//! exchange for gold. You start with no items and have as much gold as you need. Your total damage
//! or armor is equal to the sum of those stats from all of your items. You have 100 hit points.
//!
//! Here is what the item shop is selling:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! Weapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor
//! Dagger        8     4       0
//! Shortsword   10     5       0
//! Warhammer    25     6       0
//! Longsword    40     7       0
//! Greataxe     74     8       0
//!
//! Armor:      Cost  Damage  Armor
//! Leather      13     0       1
//! Chainmail    31     0       2
//! Splintmail   53     0       3
//! Bandedmail   75     0       4
//! Platemail   102     0       5
//!
//! Rings:      Cost  Damage  Armor
//! Damage +1    25     1       0
//! Damage +2    50     2       0
//! Damage +3   100     3       0
//! Defense +1   20     0       1
//! Defense +2   40     0       2
//! Defense +3   80     0       3
//! ```
//!
//! You must buy exactly one weapon; no dual-wielding. Armor is optional, but you can't use more
//! than one. You can buy 0-2 rings (at most one for each hand). You must use any items you buy.
//! The shop only has one of each item, so you can't buy, for example, two rings of Damage +3.
//!
//! For example, suppose you have 8 hit points, 5 damage, and 5 armor, and that the boss has 12 hit
//! points, 7 damage, and 2 armor:
//!
//! - The player deals `5-2 = 3` damage; the boss goes down to `9` hit points.
//! - The boss deals `7-5 = 2` damage; the player goes down to `6` hit points.
//! - The player deals `5-2 = 3` damage; the boss goes down to `6` hit points.
//! - The boss deals `7-5 = 2` damage; the player goes down to `4` hit points.
//! - The player deals `5-2 = 3` damage; the boss goes down to `3` hit points.
//! - The boss deals `7-5 = 2` damage; the player goes down to `2` hit points.
//! - The player deals `5-2 = 3` damage; the boss goes down to `0` hit points.
//!
//! In this scenario, the player wins! (Barely.)
//!
//! You have `100` hit points. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input. What is the least
//! amount of gold you can spend and still win the fight?
