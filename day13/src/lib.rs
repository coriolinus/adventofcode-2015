//! # Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table
//!
//! In years past, the holiday feast with your family hasn't gone so well. Not everyone gets along!
//! This year, you resolve, will be different. You're going to find the optimal seating arrangement
//! and avoid all those awkward conversations.
//!
//! You start by writing up a list of everyone invited and the amount their happiness would
//! increase or decrease if they were to find themselves sitting next to each other person. You
//! have a circular table that will be just big enough to fit everyone comfortably, and so each
//! person will have exactly two neighbors.
