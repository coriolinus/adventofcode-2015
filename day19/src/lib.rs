//! # Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph
//!
//! Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs
//! medicine.
//!
//! Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need
//! custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular
//! reindeer chemistry, either.
//!
//! The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of
//! constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input
//! molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.
//!
//! However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves
//! determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting
//! point.
//!
//! For example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! H => HO
//! H => OH
//! O => HH
//! ```
//!
//! Given the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:
//!
//! - `HOOH` (via `H` => `HO` on the first `H`).
//! - `HOHO` (via `H` => `HO` on the second `H`).
//! - `OHOH` (via `H` => `OH` on the first `H`).
//! - `HOOH` (via `H` => `OH` on the second `H`).
//! - `HHHH` (via `O` => `HH`).
//!
//! So, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice)
//! after one replacement from `HOH`. Santa's favorite molecule, `HOHOHO`, can become 7 distinct
//! molecules (over nine replacements: six from `H`, and three from `O`).
//!
//! The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the
//! string `H2O`, the transition `H => OO` would result in `OO2O`.
//!
//! Your puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine
//! molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be
//! created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?
