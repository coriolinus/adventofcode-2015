//! # Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say
//!
//! Today, the Elves are playing a game called look-and-say. They take turns making sequences by
//! reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example,
//! `211` is read as "one two, two ones", which becomes `1221` (`1` `2`, `2` `1`s).
//!
//! Look-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the
//! next step. For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like `111`)
//! with the number of digits (`3`) followed by the digit itself (`1`).
