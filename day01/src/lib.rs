//! --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---
//!
//! Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect fifty stars by December 25th.
//!
//! Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
//!
//! Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.
//!
//! Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.
//!
//! An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.
//!
//! The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.
//!
//! #Examples
//!
//! (()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
//!
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!( 0, count_parens("(())"    ));
//! ```
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!( 0, count_parens("()()"    ));
//! ```
//!
//! ((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
//!
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!( 3, count_parens("((("     ));
//! ```
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!( 3, count_parens("(()(()(" ));
//! ```
//!
//! ))((((( also results in floor 3.
//!
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!( 3, count_parens("))(((((" ));
//! ```
//!
//! ()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
//!
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!(-1, count_parens("())"     ));
//! ```
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!(-1, count_parens("))("    ));
//! ```
//!
//! ))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.
//!
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!(-3, count_parens(")))"     ));
//! ```
//! ```
//! # use day01::count_parens;
//! assert_eq!(-3, count_parens(")())())" ));
