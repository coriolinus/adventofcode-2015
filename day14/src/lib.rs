//! # Day 14: Reindeer Olympics
//!
//! This year is the Reindeer Olympics! Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must rest occasionally
//! to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of his reindeer is fastest, and so he
//! has them race.
//!
//! Reindeer can only either be flying (always at their top speed) or resting (not moving at all),
//! and always spend whole seconds in either state.
//!
//! For example, suppose you have the following Reindeer:
//!
//! - Comet can fly **14 km/s for 10 seconds**, but then must rest for **127** seconds.
//! - Dancer can fly **16 km/s for 11 seconds**, but then must rest for **162** seconds.
//!
//! After one second, Comet has gone 14 km, while Dancer has gone 16 km. After ten seconds, Comet
//! has gone 140 km, while Dancer has gone 160 km. On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting
//! (staying at 140 km), and Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km. On the 12th
//! second, both reindeer are resting. They continue to rest until the 138th second, when Comet
//! flies for another ten seconds. On the 174th second, Dancer flies for another 11 seconds.
//!
//! In this example, after the 1000th second, both reindeer are resting, and Comet is in the lead
//! at 1120 km (poor Dancer has only gotten 1056 km by that point). So, in this situation, Comet
//! would win (if the race ended at 1000 seconds).
//!
//! Given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds,
//! what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?
