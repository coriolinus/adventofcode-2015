//! --- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---
//!
//! Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after
//! year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid.
//!
//! Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions
//! on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.
//!
//! Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are
//! at `0,0`, `0,999`, `999,999`, and `999,0`. The instructions include whether to turn on,
//! turn off, or toggle various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs. Each coordinate pair
//! represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like `0,0 through 2,2`
//! therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.
//!
//! To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the
//! instructions Santa sent you in order.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! - turn on `0,0` through `999,999` would turn on (or leave on) every light.
//! - toggle `0,0` through `999,0` would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones
//!   that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.
//! - `turn off 499,499 through 500,500` would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.
//!
//! After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?
