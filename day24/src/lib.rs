//! # Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance
//!
//! It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is loading up the sleigh for this year's deliveries. However,
//! there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh to balance. If it isn't balanced, he can't
//! defy physics, and nobody gets presents this year.
//!
//! No pressure.
//!
//! Santa has provided you a list of the weights of every package he needs to fit on the sleigh.
//! The packages need to be split into three groups of exactly the same weight, and every package
//! has to fit. The first group goes in the passenger compartment of the sleigh, and the second
//! and third go in containers on either side. Only when all three groups weigh exactly the same
//! amount will the sleigh be able to fly. Defying physics has rules, you know!
//!
//! Of course, that's not the only problem. The first group - the one going in the passenger
//! compartment - needs as few packages as possible so that Santa has some legroom left over.
//! It doesn't matter how many packages are in either of the other two groups, so long as all of
//! the groups weigh the same.
//!
//! Furthermore, Santa tells you, if there are multiple ways to arrange the packages such that the
//! fewest possible are in the first group, you need to choose the way where the first group has
//! the smallest quantum entanglement to reduce the chance of any "complications". The quantum
//! entanglement of a group of packages is the product of their weights, that is, the value you
//! get when you multiply their weights together. Only consider quantum entanglement if the first
//! group has the fewest possible number of packages in it and all groups weigh the same amount.
//!
//! For example, suppose you have ten packages with weights 1 through 5 and 7 through 11. For this
//! situation, some of the unique first groups, their quantum entanglements, and a way to divide
//! the remaining packages are as follows:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! Group 1;             Group 2; Group 3
//! 11 9       (QE= 99); 10 8 2;  7 5 4 3 1
//! 10 9 1     (QE= 90); 11 7 2;  8 5 4 3
//! 10 8 2     (QE=160); 11 9;    7 5 4 3 1
//! 10 7 3     (QE=210); 11 9;    8 5 4 2 1
//! 10 5 4 1   (QE=200); 11 9;    8 7 3 2
//! 10 5 3 2   (QE=300); 11 9;    8 7 4 1
//! 10 4 3 2 1 (QE=240); 11 9;    8 7 5
//! 9 8 3      (QE=216); 11 7 2;  10 5 4 1
//! 9 7 4      (QE=252); 11 8 1;  10 5 3 2
//! 9 5 4 2    (QE=360); 11 8 1;  10 7 3
//! 8 7 5      (QE=280); 11 9;    10 4 3 2 1
//! 8 5 4 3    (QE=480); 11 9;    10 7 2 1
//! 7 5 4 3 1  (QE=420); 11 9;    10 8 2
//! ```
//!
//! Of these, although `10 9 1` has the smallest quantum entanglement (`90`), the configuration
//! with only two packages, `11 9`, in the passenger compartment gives Santa the most legroom and
//! wins. In this situation, the quantum entanglement for the ideal configuration is therefore 99.
//! Had there been two configurations with only two packages in the first group, the one with the
//! smaller quantum entanglement would be chosen.
