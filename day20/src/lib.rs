//! # Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses
//!
//! To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-to-door. He sends
//! them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
//!
//! Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on that number:
//!
//!  - The first Elf (number 1) delivers presents to every house: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ....
//!  - The second Elf (number 2) delivers presents to every second house: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ....
//!  - Elf number 3 delivers presents to every third house: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ....
//!
//! There are infinitely many Elves, numbered starting with 1. Each Elf delivers presents equal to
//! ten times his or her number at each house.
//!
//! So, the first nine houses on the street end up like this:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! House 1 got 10 presents.
//! House 2 got 30 presents.
//! House 3 got 40 presents.
//! House 4 got 70 presents.
//! House 5 got 60 presents.
//! House 6 got 120 presents.
//! House 7 got 80 presents.
//! House 8 got 150 presents.
//! House 9 got 130 presents.
//! ```
//!
//! The first house gets `10` presents: it is visited only by Elf 1, which delivers `1 * 10 = 10`
//!  presents. The fourth house gets `70` presents, because it is visited by Elves 1, 2, and 4, for
//!  a total of `10 + 20 + 40 = 70` presents.
//!
//! What is the lowest house number of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in
//! your puzzle input?
