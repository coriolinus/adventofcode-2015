//! # Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX
//!
//! Little Henry Case decides that defeating bosses with swords and stuff is boring. Now he's
//! playing the game with a wizard. Of course, he gets stuck on another boss and needs your help
//! again.
//!
//! In this version, combat still proceeds with the player and the boss taking alternating turns.
//! The player still goes first. Now, however, you don't get any equipment; instead, you must
//! choose one of your spells to cast. The first character at or below `0` hit points loses.
//!
//! Since you're a wizard, you don't get to wear armor, and you can't attack normally. However,
//! since you do magic damage, your opponent's armor is ignored, and so the boss effectively has
//! zero armor as well. As before, if armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below
//! 1, it becomes 1 instead - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least 1 damage.
//!
//! On each of your turns, you must select one of your spells to cast. If you cannot afford to
//! cast any spell, you lose. Spells cost mana; you start with 500 mana, but have no maximum limit.
//! You must have enough mana to cast a spell, and its cost is immediately deducted when you cast
//! it. Your spells are Magic Missile, Drain, Shield, Poison, and Recharge.
//!
//! - Magic Missile costs `53` mana. It instantly does `4` damage.
//! - Drain costs `73` mana. It instantly does `2` damage and heals you for `2` hit points.
//! - Shield costs `113` mana. It starts an effect that lasts for `6` turns. While it is active,
//!   your armor is increased by `7`.
//! - Poison costs `173` mana. It starts an effect that lasts for `6` turns. At the start of each
//!   turn while it is active, it deals the boss `3` damage.
//! - Recharge costs `229` mana. It starts an effect that lasts for `5` turns. At the start of
//!   each turn while it is active, it gives you `101` new mana.
//!
//!  Effects all work the same way. Effects apply at the start of both the player's turns and the
//!  boss' turns. Effects are created with a timer (the number of turns they last); at the start
//!  of each turn, after they apply any effect they have, their timer is decreased by one. If this
//!  decreases the timer to zero, the effect ends. You cannot cast a spell that would start an
//!  effect which is already active. However, effects can be started on the same turn they end.
//!
//! For example, suppose the player has `10` hit points and `250` mana, and that the boss has `13` hit
//! points and `8` damage:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana
//! - Boss has 13 hit points
//! Player casts Poison.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana
//! - Boss has 13 hit points
//! Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.
//! Boss attacks for 8 damage.
//!
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana
//! - Boss has 10 hit points
//! Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.
//! Player casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 24 mana
//! - Boss has 3 hit points
//! Poison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.
//! ```
//!
//! Now, suppose the same initial conditions, except that the boss has `14` hit points instead:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana
//! - Boss has 14 hit points
//! Player casts Recharge.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 21 mana
//! - Boss has 14 hit points
//! Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 4.
//! Boss attacks for 8 damage!
//!
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 122 mana
//! - Boss has 14 hit points
//! Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 3.
//! Player casts Shield, increasing armor by 7.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 110 mana
//! - Boss has 14 hit points
//! Shield's timer is now 5.
//! Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 2.
//! Boss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!
//!
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 1 hit point, 7 armor, 211 mana
//! - Boss has 14 hit points
//! Shield's timer is now 4.
//! Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 1.
//! Player casts Drain, dealing 2 damage, and healing 2 hit points.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 3 hit points, 7 armor, 239 mana
//! - Boss has 12 hit points
//! Shield's timer is now 3.
//! Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 0.
//! Recharge wears off.
//! Boss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!
//!
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 340 mana
//! - Boss has 12 hit points
//! Shield's timer is now 2.
//! Player casts Poison.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 167 mana
//! - Boss has 12 hit points
//! Shield's timer is now 1.
//! Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.
//! Boss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!
//!
//! -- Player turn --
//! - Player has 1 hit point, 7 armor, 167 mana
//! - Boss has 9 hit points
//! Shield's timer is now 0.
//! Shield wears off, decreasing armor by 7.
//! Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.
//! Player casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.
//!
//! -- Boss turn --
//! - Player has 1 hit point, 0 armor, 114 mana
//! - Boss has 2 hit points
//! Poison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.
//! ```
//!
//! You start with 50 hit points and 500 mana points. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle
//! input. What is the least amount of mana you can spend and still win the fight? (Do not include
//! mana recharge effects as "spending" negative mana.)
